# Traccoon

Track and visualise your working time.

Traccoon is a simple freeform app to help you gain insight into working habits, and depending on what kind of paid work - the amount of value generated from that working time. Think of it as Apple Health or iOS Screen Time but for work. 

It's useful for certain kinds of freelancers and anyone who does any sort of work on their own timeframe.

Traccoon is a simple web app that runs locally, and uses .tracc files to store and load your database of working information.

## Things Traccoon does:

- Helps you understand how much time you're spending working and when you're working through clean and simple visualisations.
- If projects have monetary value, how much monetary value you're generating for the time you're  working.
- If a project has sub-tasks, how much time you're spending on those sub-tasks.


## Things Traccoon doesn't do:

- Have invoicing capabilities.
- Store notes on project (you can only give projects names).
- Manage your time for you - if you have time limits on work sessions (Pomodoro, etc.), that would have to be managed with something else.
